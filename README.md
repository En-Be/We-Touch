## A pattern memory game

The classic handheld flashing lights reimagined for touch screens.
Initially a minimalist game but really the MVP for a series of interactive poems.

## Gameplay

The original game was restricted to playing with fixed buttons made of plastic:

There was no win state, the length of the longest sequence you remembered was your high score.

Taking inspriration from this but with the flexibility of being able to display anything:

Again the win state will just be a highscore, but it would be nice to add effects when the player is drawing.
